 I am currently working in Huawei Technologies as a router platform software engineer. 

 I finished my M.S degree in Computer Engineering in Rutgers University on Octuber, 2017.  

 I am experienced in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Web Developing, Android Developing and so on. The programming languages I frequently used are C, lua, Python, Java, C++. Besides, I am also good at Git, Linux, and auto testing. 

 Coding is not the only part of my life. I am trying to be a full of shit boy. During spare time, I would very like to spend a whole day for video games, baseketball, poker, bboying and chilling with my boys. 

 My dream is to become a software product manager like Ben Horowitz. Shout out to Ben Horowitz.
