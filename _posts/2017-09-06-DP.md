Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it into subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again. Following are the two main properties of a problem that suggest that the given problem can be solved using Dynamic programming.  

1) Overlapping Subproblems  
2) Optimal Substructure

f(n) = f(n/i) + i;  

### 4 Keys Keyboard  
{% highlight java %}
public int maxA(int N) {
  int[] dp = new int[N+1];
  for (int i = 0; i < N+1; i++) {
    dp[i] = i;
    for (int j = 3; j < i; j++) {
      dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j-i] * (j-1));
    }
  }
  return dp[N];

### Palindromic Substrings


### Longest Common Subsequence
if last same: dp[n, m] = 1 + dp[n-1, m - 1]
else: dp[n, m] = Math.max(dp[n-1, m], dp[n, m-1])
