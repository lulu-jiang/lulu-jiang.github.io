tags: Java, HashMap

###  intro
* inherited from Map interface
* key and value could be null (different from hashtable)
* asynchronize (different from hashtabel)
* so if we want a thread safe HashMap, we should do the following:
{% highlight Java %}
Map map = new Collections.sychronizedMap(new HashMap());
{% endhightlight %}

### data structure
* array and linkedList 
* find value accroding to hashcode(calculate hashcode based on key, then calculate hashvalue based on hashcode. If the hashvalue is appeared before, the collision occur.)
* the collision is handled by linkedList.
