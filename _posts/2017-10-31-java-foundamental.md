## abstract class vs interface
| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Type of methods   | Interface can have only abstract methods. Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods. From Java 8, it can have default and static methods also. |
| Variable | Interface has only static and final variables. The variables declared in interface are by default final. Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. |
| Implementation | Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface, but interface cannot implement abstract class. |
| Inheritance and abstraction | A Java interface can be implemented using keyword “implements” and abstract class can be extended using keyword “extends”. |
| Multiple implementation | An interface can extend another java interface only, an abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple java interfaces.|
|Accessibility of Data Members | Members of a java interface are public by default. A java abstract class have class members like private, protected, etc. |
